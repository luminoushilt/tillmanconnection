They were known as the Herring brothers as freed men changed their name to Tillman. Russell had 15 children and Alex 5 children. The descendants of which we are in search of. 
			p With our Mississippi roots many migrated to the north and beyond. An entire generation of mine (picture1)was a part of that great migration. Myself (Sullivan Montgomery) I live in Seattle Washington and born in St. Louis Missouri. 
			p My mom Leomia Jenkins Montgomery Tillman (picture 2)was born in St Louis (b. June 13,1924)and her dad Charles Tillman Jr. (picture 3)was born in Mississippi then migrated to St Louis Missouri. His father Charles Tillman whoâ€™s father was Doc Tillman also born in Mississippi and his father was Alex Tillman. All of which I have many cousins you may be a part of or know.
